							Introduction :->
	
Sentiment analysis (also referred as opinion mining) is the study of affective states and subjective information in the customer data (such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media) by using natural language processing and data mining techniques [->1<-]. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to some object, such as a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation, affective state, or the intended emotional communication.

	For opinion mining or sentiment analysis some methods are applied like – Naive Bayes Machine Learning Classifier, Senti Word Net, Support Vector Machine.Here we have used Lexicon based approach of Sentiment Analysis.Sentiment lexicon is used in the lexicon based approach. Sentiment lexicon is a collection of known and defined words. A specific sentiment is assigned to each word in the collection. The lexicon based approach is divided into dictionary based approach and corpus based approach[->gg<-].

	Sentiment analysis task is divided into three categories; Aspect level, Sentence level, Document level [3]. It is shown in Fig. 1. Aspect level analysis deal with the aspects of items. It can also be considered as phrase level analysis. In Sentence level, each sentence is considered as an entity. Summation method is used to provide overall result of the document. In document level, the whole document is
considered as a single entity.

	Sentiment analysis has been studied in wide area of domain such as movie review, teaching review [->1gg1<-], product review, e-learning, hotel review and many more. A small number of studies have focused on applying machine learning techniques in the tourism sector. 

	 A recent study [->1**1<-] aimed to create a system that would assist users in understanding tourism opinions on the web by finding and extracting subjective information from reviews in tourism websites. Aspect extraction was performed with the use of frequent nouns and the opinion was determined. 

	Estela Marine-Roig et al. [->5555<-] addressed the problem of finding out the frequently occurring trends of different tourist places from tourist opinions. The authors proposed a trends extraction framework that consisted of five phases i.e. semiautomatic downloading, arranging, cleaning, debugging, and analyzing. Trends extraction framework is better than previous method Liu (2011) in trends extraction because two extra phases of cleaning and debugging has been added up to eliminate the noise present in the tourist's opinions. The
limitations of the work are that i. Method does not classify the derived frequent trends into positive and negative trends ii. method extracts same trend in one opinion sentence multiple times that create the reputation of trends iii. Method extracts many irrelevant and meaningless trends during classification. 


	In another way to enhance the performance of opinion sentences extraction Shimada, K.. [->12**<-] used support vector machine for sentences classification. The authors addressed the problem to identify whether tweet on-site are more likelihood or tweet off-site. The authors proposed a method to evaluate on-site likelihood. Firstly, this method takes tweets and identifies tourism related tweets. Secondly, extracts tourism related tweets and deletes the remaining ones. Lastly classifies the extracted tweets on the basis of different features
of tourist places using SVM. The finding of this paper is that classification has improved by applying the method of on-site likelihood filtering method. The same fact is shown in the results i.e. without applying this filtering method Recall=58.2% and Precision=75.0% and after applying the filtering method Recall=65.0% and Precision=80.5%. If there is a location name at the start of any tweet then it is high onsite likelihood tweet. The limitations of the work are that i. mostly the comments of authors on tweets are more than any
other person which are mostly positive or negative that create nose in sentiment analysis ii. method extracts some sentences in which no opinion about targeted tourist place is given that creates noise during classification of reviews. 


							Lexicon Based :->

	Undoubtedly, the most important indicator of sentiments are sentiment words. These are words that are commonly used to express positive or negative sentiments. For example, good, wonderful, and amazing are positive sentiment words, and bad, poor, and terrible are negative sentiment words, Sentiment words are instrumental to sentiment analysis for obvious reason. A list of such words are called a sentiment lexicon (or opinion lexicon). Over the years, researchers have designed numerous algorithms to compile such lexicons.
	Although sentiment words are important for sentiment analysis, only using them is not sufficient. The problem is much more complex.
	Some issues related to lexicon based approach are given below:
1.) A positive or negative sentiment word may have opposite orientations in different application domains.
	For example, “dangerous” is a negative word but it can also be highly positive when someone posts “dangerous tasty”.
2.) A sentence containing sentiment words may not express any sentiment. This happens frequently in question types of sentences. 
	For example, “Suggest a good coffee shop around gulshan n banani...”
3.) Many sentences without sentiment words can also imply opinion.
	For example, “They took a lot of time to serve us”. 
This sentence has a negative sentiment. In recent time many researchers are working on lexicon based approach [->5<-].


							Dataset :->

	In this section, details of data gathered in our study is provided. For this purpose, Twitter APIs were used to gather publicly available Twitter data which is commonly used for research in social opinion mining and sentiment analysis. First we selected twitter profile of Ministry Of India, which has 5589 tweeets and 85.9K followers(as of March, 2018). The data was then acquired for period of a year which constituted several thousands of tweets in english. The long duration of data capturing enables us to achieve the desired richness in our corpus.

	There are numerous issues with Twitter data due to the fact that people use short hands, misspell words, and often join two words by mistake. Social media users do not usually post content by following proper language rules. The sources in the study had content following proper language rules.
